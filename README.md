# Welcome!

### I'm Gabriel Zinato, from São Paulo, Brazil. I completed a B.Sc. in Geology at the [Universidade de São Paulo](https://igc.usp.br/en/) in 2018. In July 2022, I completed a one year Data Science course at [Let's Code](https://letscode.com.br/), currently rebranded as [Ada Tech](https://ada.tech/). I'm really enjoying this field and have been putting a lot of effort and time into learning as much as I can about Data Science and Machine Learning. I'll be posting my projects here to use this space as a portfolio and to allow me to track my progress.

### My work Experience:

### I worked for four months as a Data Analyst at [Revista Oeste](https://revistaoeste.com/), helping keep track of KPIs based on the data we had on the subscriptions of the magazine.
### At [Maida Health](https://maida.health/sobre-nos), I worked as a Data Scientist, studying the data we had from our clients (health ensurance plans) to help them mitigate expenditures and plan ahead. My MBA's project was about studying frauds on medical examination requests from one of our clients and it diminished the costs our client in over 15%.
### Currently, I'm working as a Data Scientist at [Turing](https://turing.com), helping fine-tune an LLM for one of our clients.
